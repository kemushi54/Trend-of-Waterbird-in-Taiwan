##Introduction
To make the decisions on biodiversity conservation, it is necessary to evaluate the population trends of target species. For the migratory waterbirds of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), Taiwan is one of the most important stopover sites and wintering sites for them and the Taiwanese birders have accumulated a huge volume of data. However, the distribution data of migratory waterbirds have not been integrated and analyzed effectively, especially for the long-term population trends. Therefore, this study aims at (1) harmonize the data from different sources and (2) identify the population trends of the target species.
